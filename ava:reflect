My personal project for September was making a Tic Tac Toe game with Sarah Marvin. We both worked on it multiple times but did not get a chance to finish it so we plan on extending this porject into the next IDP. As of now, we have a lot of errors but we are trying to print out the board as well as work on the moves of each player. Something I think we can work on is being more communicative about when we work on the project and making sure to prioritize the project. Next month, I hope we finish the project. 


October IDP 
10/3/21 - 10/10/21 : worked on fixing the errors that we had and finished the game so now it works properly  
10/18/21 - found out about the function windowResize and used that so the canvas was always in the middle no matter the screen 
        - was easy to do this because all of the rest of the code was relative instead of being in an exact location 

My goal for this project along with Sarah Marvins was to finish this project and get rid of all of the errors we handed in for the September IDP. By working together we were able to solve the problems as well as make our own adjustments like adjusting where the game was placed in the window. Sarah and I worked really well together even though the way we do our work is very different so I think it balanced it out well nicely. Next project, I am not totally sure what I am going to do but I really liked the filter porject so I may make more of those.
